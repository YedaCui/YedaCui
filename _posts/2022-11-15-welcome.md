Welcome to Yeda CUI's website. I am a second Year PhD student at CUHK with supervisor Prof. Li Lingfei. I am interested in derivatives pricing and Hedging and alpha seeking. I will share some of my leaning notes and project experience.

Leave some junk here.


Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
